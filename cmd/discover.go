The discover cmd builds ArgoCD application resources based on any file, it finds in the current folder and subfolders,
that contains 'apiVersion: argocd-discover/v1alpha1' as the first line of the file.

This is done by walking through the folder structure reading the first line of any '*.yaml' file,
and checking if it matches 'apiVersion: argocd-discover/v1alpha1' if it does, it reads the rest of the content,
which describes the chart that should be used and where it should be deployed.
